# OOPS-PYTHON

ðŸš€ This repository is a demo for learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python.

## Contents

- `oop_concepts.py`: A Python script that demonstrates the following OOP concepts with examples:
  - Classes and Objects
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction

## OOP Concepts Explained

### 1. Classes and Objects
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class.


### 2. Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.


### 3. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.


### 4. Encapsulation
Encapsulation restricts access to certain attributes and methods, making them private.


### 5. Abstraction
Abstraction hides the complex implementation details and shows only the essential features of the object.
